# Old YouTube Redirect

Dislike YouTube's (polymer) redesign? Old YouTube Redirect will ensure that you always load the old design instead.

Will add disable_polymer=1 to the query string of all YouTube pages. Will work when navigating to the site, opening links, using old bookmarks. Works regardless of whether you are logged in or not, and in incognito mode (if you allow the add-on to run in incognito mode).
