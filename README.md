# Old YouTube Redirect

Dislike YouTube's (polymer) redesign? Old YouTube Redirect will ensure that you always load the old design instead.

Will add disable_polymer=1 to the query string of all YouTube pages. Will work when navigating to the site, opening links, using old bookmarks. Works regardless of whether you are logged in or not, and in incognito mode (if you allow the add-on to run in incognito mode).

Forked from [Old Reddit Redirect](https://github.com/tom-james-watson/old-reddit-redirect)

## Known issues

**This code no longer works for me, I am not aware of any way to switch to the old YouTube layout any more.**

When YouTube is loaded from a link or URL the page needs to be refreshed before the old version is displayed, clicking links within YouTube doesn't cause this issue.
